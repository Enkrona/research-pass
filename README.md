.masks files are used as pattern lists 

hashcat -a3 appleSHA256.txt apple.masks -m 1400

This command will utilize hashcat to bruteforce all password hashes found within appleHash.txt using apple.masks as the patterns for generating vlaid passwords. Thereby, this will reduce the ammount of "junk" or impossible combinations which will never be valid, and only generate crack passwords which follow the minimum spec requirements which Apple has (and mirrored in apple.masks). -m 1400 is the flag which specifies SHA256 hashes. 


policygen 0.0.2 was utilized to generate .masks which are patterns for generating valid passwords. 

policygen --minlength=7 --maxleangth=7 --mindigit=1 --maxdigit=1 --minlower=6 --maxlower=6 --maxupper=0 --maxspecial=0 -o github.masks

This command will then generate the masks for GitHub. Essentially, GitHub's minimum req is 7 characters, with one number. 


TODO: 
@Enkrona Look into where hashcat stores "Restore points" for ability to recover work done, if something were to crash
@Enkrona Migrate files into a more logical organizational structure 
@Enkrona Install hashcat on Bartik
